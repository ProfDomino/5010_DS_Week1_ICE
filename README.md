# Congrats!

 You pulled this down! You can successfully interact with github classroom and you're free of all of this one-time setup business.  

 The last thing for today is to just shake some of the winter-break rust off.  There are 3 python challenges in `practice.py`.  
 
 Complete those correctly and you're all set for today!  You're welcome to hang out and help your peers or take an early day.
